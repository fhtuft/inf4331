The highlighter and diff is done in the standard way. Diff is a solution of the Longest common subsequence problem, the algorithm is from, Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition MIT Press. 
The highlighert is done as a lexer/scanner same as in inf2100 or inf5110. Only diff is that we use regex, in this course for some reason, not a finite state machine, but those are of course equivalent. Colours are as mutch as possible the same as in gvim... For 5_2 theme2 they are different. 

Assignemts: 
5.1 : highligher.py
5.2: run bash file 5_2.sh
5_3: run bahs file 5_3.sh , language is C
5_4: run bash file 5_4.sh , language is Java
5_5: run bash file 5_5.sh,runs all tests, test files are in diffTest dir. Things tested for addition,subtraction, permutation, complitly different, same files.
5_6: run bash file 5_6.sh, file is colour_diff.py  

Every thing seems to work, I run Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 3.5.2 :: Anaconda 4.2.0 (64-bit).
